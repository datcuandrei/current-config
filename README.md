# My current config

This configuration is for i3wm. I have currently switched to GNOME.
My GNOME configuration is pretty much default, the only extension I have installed is Pop Shell.

## Every config location

- `i3` -> contents go to `.config/i3`
- `moc` -> home directory,rename to `.moc`
- `picom.conf` or `compton.conf` -> `.config`
- `xfce4/terminal` -> contents go to `.config/xfce4/terminal`
