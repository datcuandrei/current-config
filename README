current-i3-config
==================
My i3 config files.

Note that this configuration doesn't include i3wm-mac-syskeys.I chose not to include it,as this configuration will be used on other computers too,not just my Mac.

Components list :

   - i3status is a utility to generate a string with information to be displayed in the i3bar.
   - dmenu is a utility to launch our apps in the i3 desktop.
